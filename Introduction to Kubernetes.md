## Why Kubernetes?
---
- Kubernetes has emerged as a leading cloud computing tool, gaining popularity and widespread adoption.
- It is rapidly becoming a common choice for major companies actively migrating their infrastructure to leverage the [[Power and Benefits of Kubernetes]].

## What is Kubernetes?
---
- Kubernetes is an open-source [[Container]] orchestration platform that automates containerized application's deployment, scaling, and management.
- Google initially developed it, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

##  What problems does Kubernetes solve?
---
- With the rise of microservices architecture, there has been an increased demand for containerized applications.
- Managing many containers in an environment through manual scripting can be challenging.
- Kubernetes solves this problem by providing an efficient and automated approach to manage containers.
- For example, the popular dating app Tinder uses 48,000 running containers to serve its users. Without Kubernetes, provisioning and managing these containers in a production environment would be incredibly difficult.
- All these demanded a proper way of maintaining hundreds or thousands of container workloads.
