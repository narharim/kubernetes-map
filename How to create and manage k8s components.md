 - There are actually two ways to create and manage K8s components.
 - Imperative and declarative

|Approach|Imperative|Declarative|
|---|---|---|
|Explanation|Telling Kubernetes **what to do**|Telling Kubernetes **what we want**|
|Tool|Kubernetes CLI (e.g., `kubectl`)|Kubernetes configuration files (YAML)|
|Capability|Enables direct interaction with the clusters|Provides an alternative for managing more complex architectures|
|Operations|Operate directly on live objects|Operate on object's configuration files|
|Limitation|Not suitable for managing complex architectures|YAML configuration files offer a more scalable approach for complex scenarios|
